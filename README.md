# Assignment 2: Classify
In this project, we design a basic system using RISC-V assembly language, implementing fundamental matrix and vector operations, including matrix multiplication. These functions act as core components for building a simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN) aimed at classifying handwritten digits.

The project is organized into two main components:mathematical functions and file operations. The mathematical functions cover various matrix and vector operations, such as ```ReLU```, ```ArgMax```, ```Dot Product```, and ```Matrix Multiplication```. The second part includes all file-related operations and the main logic of the program.


## 1. Part A: Mathematical Functions

### 1.1 ReLU
In ```relu.s```, each element of the input array will be processed by setting negative values to 0. The operation is defined as:
```math
ReLU(a)=max(a,0)
```
The inputs for this operation and their corresponding registers are as follows:

*	```a0``` : (int*) pointer to interger array to be modified.
*	```a1``` : (int) number of elements in array.
  
First, the register ```t0``` is initialized as a counter ```i``` to track the position of the current element in the input array. The register ```t1``` holds the address of the i-th element, and the value at this address is loaded into register ```t2```. The operation then checks whether the value is negative. If it is, the value is set to 0; otherwise, it remains unchanged.

### 1.2 ArgMax
In ```argmax.s```, implement the argmax funxtion, which returns the index of the largest element in a given vector. The inputs for this operation and their corresponding registers are as follows:

*	```a0``` : (int*) pointer to the first element of the array.
*	```a1``` : (int) number of elements in the array.

The return for this operation and its corresponding register is as follows:
* ```a0``` : (int) position of the first maximum element.

The registers ```t0``` and ```t1``` are initialized with the maximum value of the input array and the counter ```i```, respectively. Using a for loop, the operation checks whether each element is greater than the current maximum value stored in register ```t0```. If an element is greater, the maximum value in ```t0``` and the index of the first occurrence of the maximum value in register ```a0``` are updated. The function returns the value in register ```a0``` upon completion.

### 1.3 Dot Product
In ```dot.s```, implement the dot product function, which calculates the dot product of two given vectors. It defined as:
```math
dot(a, b) = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (a_i Â· b_i)
```
The inputs for this operation and their corresponding registers are as follows:
*	```a0``` : (int*) pointer to the first input array (M1).
*	```a1``` : (int*) pointer to the second input array (M2).
*	```a2``` : (int) number of elements to process.
*	```a3``` : (int) skip distance in the first array.
*	```a4``` : (int) skip distance in the second array.

The return for this operation and its corresponding register is as follows:
*	```a0``` : (int) resulting for product value.

This operation implements a dot product calcuation function with strides. First, register ```t0``` is initialized to store the sum of the products. Then, the addresses of ```M1[i*stride]``` and ```M2[i*stride]``` are calculated, and the values at these addresses are loaded into registers ```t3``` and ```t5```, respectively.

Subsequently, the operation checks whether either the value at ```M1[i*stride]``` or ```M2[i*stride]``` is negative. If either value is negative, multiplication is performed using subtraction. Otherwise, multiplication is performed using addition.

Eventually, the sum register ```t0``` is updated by adding the result of the multiplication, and upon completion, the dot product value is returned.

### 1.4 Matrix Multiplication
In ```matmul.s```, implement the matrix multiplication, where:
```math
C[i][j]=dot(A[i],B[:j])
```
The inputs for this operation and their corresponding registers are as follows:
*	```a0``` : (int*) pointer to the memory address of the first matrix.
*	```a1``` : (int) row count of the first matrix.
*	```a2``` : (int) column count of the second matrix.
*	```a3``` : (int*) pointer to the memory address of the second matrix.
*	```a4``` : (int) row count of the first matrix.
*	```a5``` : (int) column count of the second matrix.
*	```a6``` : (int*) point to the memory address of output matrix.

The matrix multiplication operation relies on the dot product. It iterates through the rows of the first matrix with the outer loop, and through the columns of the second matrix with the inner loop, calculating the dot product of the corresponding elements. The ```dot``` function is called internally to compute the dot product of two arrays, which serves as the fundamental operation in matrix multiplication.

## 2. Part B: File Operations and Main

### 2.1 Read Matrix
In ```read_matrix.s```, implement the function to read a binary matrix from a file and load it into memory. The inputs for this operation and their corresponding registers are as follows:
* ```a0``` : (char*) pointer to filename string.
* ```a1``` : (int*) address to write row count.
* ```a2``` : (int*) address to write column count.

The function will return the following value in the specified register:
* ```a0``` : (int*) pointer to base address of loaded matrix.



### 2.2 Write Matrix
In ```write_matrix.s```, implement the function to write a matrix to a binary file. The function takes the following inputs with corresponding registers:
* ```a0``` : (char*) pointer to a string representing the filename.
* ```a1``` : (int*) pointer to the starting memory address of the matrix.
* ```a2``` : (int) number of rows in the matrix.
* ```a3``` : (int) number of columns in the matrix.

### 2.3 Classification
In ```classify.s```, the function binds all components necessary to classify an input using two weight matrices (```m0``` and ```m1```) and the specified operations.  The function takes in three parameters with corresponding registers as follows:
* ```a0``` : (int) argument count
* ```a1``` : (char**) argument vector
* ```a2``` : (int) silent mode flag

The classification result of this operation is returned in the following register:
* ```a0``` : (int) classification result
